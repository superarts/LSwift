I asked a question regarding `NSURLConnection` on [stackoverflow][stackoverflow] about why `NSURLConnectionDelegate` and `NSURLConnectionDataDelegate` don't work for generic classes. Someone asked me why I would like to use generic class in the first place. I think one of the reasons he asked was that generic is a newly introduced feature in `Swift` and it's may make things more complicated than they should be. I briefly answered it in [the original question][stackoverflow], but I'd like to write more about `LRestClient`.

(To be continued...)
